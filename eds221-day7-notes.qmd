## Working with relational database managements systems

working with relational databases

-   Mutating joins = adds new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another

-   Filtering joins = filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table

-   Key = a variable that store unique information that can be used to connect information across datasets

# Different types of joins

## full_join(x, y)

= everything from both data frames is retained, regardless of whether or not it has a match in the data frame it's being joined to

When you run full_join(animals, sites), you'll get:

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202023-08-22%20at%2010.22.33%20AM.png)

## left_join(x,y)

= everything in x is kept. Things from y that *have* a matching key in x are joined to it. Things in y that do *not* have a matching key in x are dropped.

example:

What do we expect for left_join(animals,sites)?

## inner_join(x,y)

= only keep stuff if they have a key match in x and y

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202023-08-22%20at%2010.37.39%20AM.png)

What is the output of inner_join(animals, sites)?

# Interactive Session 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Data wrangling refresher

1.  Starting from penguins, write a single piped sequence in which you
    -   only include penguins at Dream and Biscoe islands

    -   Remove the year and sex variables

    -   Add a new column body_mass_kg with penguin mass converted from g to kg

    -   Rename the island variable to location

```{r}
        # my answer
        # warmup_1 <- penguins %>% 
        #   filter(island == "Dream" | island == "Biscoe") %>% 
        #   select(-(year), -(sex)) %>% 
        #   mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g /1000) %>% 
        #   mutate(location = island)

        # class example
        warmup_1 <- penguins %>% 
          filter(island %in% c("Dream", "Biscoe")) %>% 
          select(-year, -sex) %>% 
          mutate(body_mass_kg = (body_mass_g /1000)) %>% 
          mutate(location = island)
```

2.  Starting from penguins, write a single piped sequence to:
    -   Limit to Adelie penguins

    -   Remove any observation where flipper_length_mm is NA - !is.na() or drop.na()

    -   Group the data by sex

    -   Create a summary table that contains the mean, standard deviation, and sample size of flipper lengths for male and female Adelie penguins

```{r}
# my answer
# warmup_2 <- penguins %>% 
#   filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
#   drop_na(flipper_length_mm) %>% 
#   group_by(sex) %>% 
#   summarize(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
#             sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
#             sample_size = n())

# class answer
warmup_2 <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie", !is.na(flipper_length_mm)) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
            sample_size = n())
```

```{r}
# count function in dyplr
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, island, sex) %>% 
  summarize(sample_size = n())

#below is the same as above. count is just wrapping togetehr group_by() + summarize() + n()
penguins %>% 
  count(species, island, sex)
```

# datapasta fun!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datapasta) # turn selectable table into dataframe in R
```

copy a random dataframe from internet, select "Addins" at the top, and paste as dataframe

example link: https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_221_programming-essentials/interactive_sessions/day_7_interactive.html

```{r}
animals <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
          location = c("lagoon", "bluff", "creek", "oaks", "bluff"),
           species = c("bobcat", "coyote", "fox", "squirrel", "bobcat"),
          maturity = c("adult", "juvenile", "adult", "juvenile", "adult")
)

sites <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
          location = c("beach", "lagoon", "bluff", "oaks"),
    full_site_name = c("Goleta Beach","UCSB Lagoon",
                       "Ellwood Mesa","Fremont Campground"),
      jurisdiction = c("SB City", "UCSB", "SB City", "USFS")
)
```

Full join:

```{r}
full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites)
```

Left join:

```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites)
```

Inner join:

```{r}
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals, sites)
```

ISO 8601 format (International Organization of Standardization)

Format: YYYY-MM-DD

What if we have more or higher resolution in time?

full date, hours, and minutes Format: YYYY-MM-DDThh::mm:TZD

full date, hours, minutes, and seconds format: YYYY-MM-DDThh::mm:ssTZD

TZD = UTC + or - where you are in the world

### example
